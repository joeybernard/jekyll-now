title: Back to Linux again
---

With a new work desktop, I decided to try and use Windows 10 as my day-to-day environment. It worked fine at the beginning, but as I moved on and did more and more work, it was causing more and more issues. The biggest problem surrounds working with code. Every solution available, like WSL or cygwin, had its own short-comings that caused me headaches. And, trying to use VirtualBox just didn't make any sense. Why would I load Windows 10 and chew up huge amounts of RAM just to run Linux? So, I finally broke down and sub-divided my hard drive to be able to dual-boot. That way, I can still use Windows for those rare occasions when I need it.
