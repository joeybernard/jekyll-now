title: USB Linux

Dual booting seemed to have not solved the biggest headache I have, running on multiple machines. I do have a github repository where I store my home directory, so I can get a new machine up and running pretty quickly, but I do enough different types of development that I have issues keeping the package list common across these machines. So, I moved to running off of a USB device. I looked at using an actual USB key drive, but the ones I could get around town had poor write speeds. So I actually moved to using a microSD card with a USB adapter. This runs well enough that I am using Ubuntu as my daily desktop now. So far so good.
