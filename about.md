I am interested in a bunch of different things. This blog will hopefully be interesting to at least some people out there. 

### More Information

I have degrees in physics and computer science. My day job is with the Radio Physics Lab in the Physics Department of UNB, where I help faculty and grad students with computational problems. On the side, I write a column for Linux Journal and also a column for Linux User & Developer.
